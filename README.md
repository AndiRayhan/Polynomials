# Polynomials
This is a simple program that can differentiate and integrate simple single-variable polynomials. To simplify the task at hand, each variable (or each "x") is modeled as an instance of the xVariable class with power and coefficient as fields. Then the polynomial class contains an arraylist of xVariable objects. Users first enter the polynomial that they wish to manipulate. The program then parses the input String and instantiates xVariable objects accordingly and "loads" an existing polynomial object with the new xVariables.
